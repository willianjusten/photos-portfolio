# Photography Portfolio

> I'll use this site to post mostly Street Photography and photos that I don't post on Unsplash due to their strict guidelines.

## How to run

Install the dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Create an account on [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) and rename the `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` adding the keys you got from Cloudinary.

Upload some photos separated by folders and that's it!

## Customize the template

The First card is the place where it has the photo, name, description, and some Social Network links. You can change those informations in the [MainCard](https://github.com/willianjusten/photos/blob/main/components/MainCard.tsx) and also the [SocialLinks](https://github.com/willianjusten/photos/blob/main/components/SocialLinks.tsx).

Also, if you want to change the colors, you can replace them on [tailwind.config.js](https://github.com/willianjusten/photos/blob/main/tailwind.config.js#L13-L20).

## Contribute

Feel free to contribute, this project has tons of places to improve, it's a good start for beginners!
